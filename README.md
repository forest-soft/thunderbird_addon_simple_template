> I was using an add-on called "SmartTemplate", which inserts a canned text like this,
> I used to use an add-on called "SmartTemplate" that inserted canned text like this, but it became unusable due to an upgrade of Thunderbird's add-on-related version.
>
> After that, I was using an add-on called "SmartTemplate4", which was created by another person,
> I had to purchase an annual license to use it, so I had to go back to typing canned text by hand.
>
> After waiting for a while, I couldn't find a good alternative, so I thought why not create one? So I decided to create an add-on.
